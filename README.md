Book Recommendation System
Overview
The Book Recommendation System is a web-based application designed to provide personalized book recommendations to users. By leveraging collaborative filtering techniques and content-based filtering methods, the system analyzes user preferences and behaviors to suggest books that align with individual tastes.

Features
1. User Authentication
Sign Up: New users can create an account by providing necessary details.

Login: Registered users can log in to access personalized recommendations and other features.

Profile Management: Users can update their personal information and preferences.

2. Book Recommendations
Popular Books: Displays a list of books that are currently trending among users.

Personalized Recommendations: Suggests books based on the user's reading history and preferences.

Category-Based Recommendations: Allows users to explore books within specific genres or categories.

3. Book Details
Comprehensive Information: Provides detailed information about each book, including title, author, genre, and a brief description.

User Reviews and Ratings: Displays reviews and ratings from other users to help inform reading choices.

4. User Interactions
Rating and Reviewing: Users can rate books they have read and leave reviews to share their opinions.

Favorites and Reading Lists: Enables users to mark books as favorites and organize them into custom reading lists.

Notifications: Keeps users informed about new recommendations, reviews on their favorite books, and other relevant updates.

5. Search and Filtering
Search Functionality: Allows users to search for books by title, author, or keywords.

Advanced Filtering: Users can filter search results based on genre, rating, and other criteria to find books that match their interests.

6. Administrative Features
Content Management: Admins can add, update, or remove book entries from the system.

User Management: Admins have the ability to manage user accounts, including moderating reviews and handling user reports.

Technical Components
1. Backend
Framework: The backend is built using Python's Flask framework, facilitating the development of web applications.

Database: Utilizes MySQL for storing user data, book information, reviews, and ratings.

Machine Learning Models: Implements collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms to generate personalized recommendations.

2. Frontend
Templates: Uses HTML templates rendered by Flask to create dynamic web pages.

Static Files: Incorporates CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactive features, enhancing the user experience.

3. Data Handling
Datasets: The system includes datasets such as Books.csv, Ratings.csv, and Users.csv located in the Dataset directory, which provide the foundational data for recommendations.

Pickle Files: Preprocessed data and trained models are stored in pickle files (books.pkl, popular.pkl, pt.pkl, similarity_scores.pkl) for efficient loading and use.

Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/HLokeshwari/Book-Recommendation-System.git

Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd Book-Recommendation-System

Install Dependencies: Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Environment Variables: Create a .env file to store environment-specific variables, such as database configurations and API keys.

Initialize the Database: Run the database setup script to create necessary tables and import data from CSV files.

Run the Application: Start the Flask development server:
python app.py
Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Usage
Explore Recommendations: Upon logging in, users can view personalized book recommendations on their dashboard.

Search for Books: Use the search bar to find specific books or browse by categories.

Interact with Content: Rate and review books, add them to favorites, and create custom reading lists.

Manage Profile: Update personal information and preferences to refine recommendation accuracy.

Security Considerations
Sensitive Data Handling: Ensure that files like client_secret.json.json and .env containing sensitive information are securely stored and not exposed in public repositories.

Authentication: Implement secure authentication mechanisms to protect user accounts.

Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
